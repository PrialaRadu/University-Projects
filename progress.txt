1. Refactored all functions (that modify/print the list) to achieve a more concise structure, reducing each to one line of code.

2. Implemented 6 test functions using the 'assert' function to verify the validity of variables (id, day, total, category, num, response).

3. Rewrote the submenus in a more concise and simple form.

4. Wrote a short summary where I detailed the purpose of the application and provided explicit references to the location of each functionality within the code.

1. Divided the primary code into modular components (main, domain_functions, test_functions, user_interface)

2. Implemented a dedicated function (get_user_expenses) to retrieve and manage all expenses from user input.
